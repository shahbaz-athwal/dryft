    You are tasked with matching professor records from our local database with Rate My Professor records.
    Instructions:
    - Match each local professor to their corresponding RMP professor based on name and department
    - Use the RMP professor's "id" field (not legacyId) as the rmpId
    - If no clear match exists, set rmpId to null
    - Consider variations in name format (e.g., "John Smith" vs "Smith, John")
    - Department names may differ but should be similar
    - Return matches for ALL local professors, even if rmpId is null

    Return a JSON object with a "matches" array containing objects with:
    - professorId: the id from local professor
    - rmpId: the id from RMP professor (or null if no match)
    `;
